# HoriseonRefactor_1.0
Bootcamp Challenge 1

Challenge is to refactor the Horiseon landing page.

HTML Changes include:
1. Rename title to company name
2. Rename Navigation DIV to NAV
3. Rename Section DIV to SECTION
4. Addition of image ALT descriptions. (max 140 characters)
5. Change footer DIV to FOOTER

CSS Changes include:
1. Shortend "header h1 .seo" to just .seo since it can be targeted directly.
2. Found a number of duplicate styles that I was able to reduce into one style.
3. Renamed headers, footers and section styles to match new symantic tags instead of old classes.
NOTE: Old content was left in but commented out so the changes can be seen easier. 
I also did not re-order some of the new content to make it easier to see the changes 
but normally I would move all content styles to a content section and so forth.
